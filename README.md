# Terraform Deployment Guide for Software NGFW with Network Security Integration


This tutorial shows how to deploy Palo Alto Networks Software Firewalls in Google Cloud, utilizing either the *in-line* or *out-of-band* deployment model within the [Network Security Integration](https://cloud.google.com/network-security-integration/docs/nsi-overview) (NSI).  NSI enables you to gain  visibility and security for your VPC network traffic, without requiring any changes to your network infrastructure.  

The functionality of each model is summarized as follows:

| Model           | Description             |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Out-of-Band** | Uses packet mirroring to forward a copy of network traffic to Software Firewalls for *out-of-band* inspection. Traffic is mirrored to your software firewalls by creating mirroring rules within your network firewall policy. |
| **In-line**     | Uses packet intercept to steer network traffic to Software Firewalls for *in-line* inspection. Traffic is steered to your software firewalls by creating firewall rules within your network firewall policy. |

This tutorial is intended for network administrators, solution architects, and security professionals who are familiar with [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute) and [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networking](https://cloud.google.com/vpc).

## Architecture

NSI follows a *producer-consumer* model, where the *consumer* consumes services provided by the *producer*. The *producer* contains the cloud infrastructure responsible for inspecting network traffic, while the *consumer* environment contains the cloud resources that require inspection.

<img src="images/diagram.png" width="100%">

### Producer Components

The producer creates firewalls which serve as the backend service for an internal load balancer. For each zone requiring traffic inspection, the producer creates a forwarding rule, and links it to an *intercept* or *mirroring* *deployment* which is a zone-based resource. These are consolidated into an *deployment group*, which is then made accessible to the consumer.

| Component | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| [Load Balancer](https://cloud.google.com/network-security-integration/docs/out-of-band/configure-producer-service#create-int-lb-pm) | An internal network load balancer that distributes traffic to the NGFWs. |
| [Deployments](https://cloud.google.com/network-security-integration/docs/out-of-band/deployments-overview) | A zonal resource that acts as a backend of the load balancer, providing network inspection on traffic from the consumer. |
| [Deployment Group](https://cloud.google.com/network-security-integration/docs/out-of-band/deployment-groups-overview) | A collection of intercept or mirroring deployments that are set up across multiple zones within the same project.  It represents the firewalls as a service that consumers reference. |
| [Instance Group](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups) | A managed or unmanaged instance group that contains the firewalls which enable horizontal scaling. |


#### Zone Affinity Considerations

The internal load balancer lacks zone-based affinity support. Therefore, consider the following architectures for your firewall deployment:

* **Zone-Based**: Ensures traffic is inspected by a firewall in the same zone as the consumer's source zone.
* **Cross-Zone**: Allows traffic to be inspected by any firewall within the same region as the traffic's source.

        <li><b>Repeat steps 3-5</b> for each zone requiring inspection.</li>
      </ol>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>

### Consumer Components

The consumer creates an *intercept* or *mirroring* *endpoint group* corresponding to the producer's *deployment group*. Then, the consumer associates the endpoint group with VPC networks requiring inspection. 

Finally, the consumer creates a network firewall policy with rules that use a *security profile group* as their action.  Traffic matching these rules is intercepted or mirrored to the producer for inspection.

| Component | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| [Endpoint Group](https://cloud.google.com/network-security-integration/docs/out-of-band/endpoint-groups-overview) | A project-level resource that directly corresponds to a producer's deployment group. This group can be associated with multiple VPC networks. |
| [Endpoint Group Association](https://cloud.google.com/network-security-integration/docs/out-of-band/configure-mirroring-endpoint-group-associations) | Associates the endpoint group to consumer VPCs. |
| [Firewall Rules](https://cloud.google.com/firewall/docs/network-firewall-policies) | Exists within Network Firewall Policies and select traffic to be intercepted or mirrored for inspection by the producer. |
| [Security Profiles](https://cloud.google.com/network-security-integration/docs/security-profiles-overview) | Can be type `intercept` or `mirroring` and are set as the action within firewall rules. |

<br>

### Traffic Flow Example

The network firewall policy associated with the `consumer-vpc` contains two rules, each specifying a security profile group as their action. When traffic matches either rule, the traffic is encapsulated to the producer for inspection. Both rules and the security profile group are created automatically by Terraform.

<table>
  <tr>
    <!-- Title cell with left alignment -->
    <th colspan="5" align="center">Network Firewall Policy</th>
  </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>PRIORITY</th>
        <th>DIRECTION</th>
        <th>SOURCE</th>
        <th>DESTINATION</th>
        <th>ACTION</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>10</code></td>
        <td><code>Egress</code></td>
        <td><code>0.0.0.0/8</code></td>
        <td><code>0.0.0.0/0</code></td>
        <td><code>apply-security-profile</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>11</code></td>
        <td><code>Ingress</code></td>
        <td><code>0.0.0.0/0</code></td>
        <td><code>0.0.0.0/8</code></td>
        <td><code>apply-security-profile</code></td>
    </tr>
</table>

> [!NOTE]
> In the *out-of-band* model, traffic would be mirrored to the firewalls instead of redirected.  


#### Traffic to Producer
<img src="images/diagram_flow1.png" width="100%">

1. The `web-vm` makes a request to the internet. The request is evaluated against the rules within the Network Firewall Policy associated with the `consumer-vpc`.
2. The request matches the `EGRESS` rule (priority: `10`) that specifies a security profile group as its action.
3. The request is then encapsulated through the `endpoint association` to the producer environment.
4. Within the producer environment, the `intercept deployment group` directs traffic to the `intercept deployment` located in the same zone as the `web-vm`.
5. The internal load balancer forwards the traffic to an available firewall for deep packet inspection.

#### Traffic from Producer
<img src="images/diagram_flow2.png" width="100%">

1. If the firewall permits the traffic, it is returned to the `web-vm` via the consumer's `endpoint association`.
2. The local route table of the `consumer-vpc` routes traffic to the internet via the Cloud NAT.
3. The session is established with the internet destination and is continuously monitored by the firewall.

<br>

## Create Producer Environment
In the `producer` directory, use the terraform plan to automatically create the producer's VPCs, instance template, instance group, internal load balancer, NSI intercept deployment group, and NSI intercept deployment.

> [!TIP]
> In production environments, it is recommended to deploy the producer resources to a dedicated project.  This ensures the security services are managed independently of the consumer.

> [!CAUTION]
> It is required to make your cloudshell git support large file download, run below command to install git lfs before you start to clone the source code.
  
    sudo apt install git-lfs


1. In [Cloud Shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com), clone the repository change to the `producer` directory. 

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/google-cloud-nsi-ui-demo.git
    cd google-cloud-nsi-ui-demo/producer
    ```

2. Create a `terraform.tfvars`.

    ```
    cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
    ```

3. Edit `terraform.tfvars` by setting values for the following variables:  
   
    | Key | Value | Default |
    | :---- | :---- | :---- |
    | `project_id` | The Google Cloud project ID of the producer environment. | `null` |
    | `mgmt_allow_ips` | A list of IPv4 addresses which have access to the firewall's mgmt interface. | `["0.0.0.0/0"]` |
    | `mgmt_public_ip` | If true, the management address will have a public IP assigned to it. | `true` | 
    | `region` | The region to deploy the consumer resources. | `us-west1` |
    | `image_name` | The firewall image to deploy. | `vmseries-flex-bundle2-1126`|
    | `mirroring_mode` | If true, configures the forwarding rule for packet mirroring. If false, configures it for in-band traffic. | `false` |


> [!CAUTION]
> It is recommended to set `mgmt_public_ip` to `false` in production environments.

> [!TIP]
> For `image_name`, a full list of public images can be found with this command:
> ```
> gcloud compute images list --project paloaltonetworksgcp-public --no-standard-images
> ```
> All NSI deployments require PAN-OS 11.2.x or greater.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using BYOL image (i.e.  <code>vmseries-flex-<b>byol</b>-*</code>), the license can be applied during or after deployment.  To license during deployment, add your authcode to `bootstrap_files/authcodes`.  See [Bootstrap Methods](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/vm-series/11-1/vm-series-deployment/bootstrap-the-vm-series-firewall) for more information.  


4. Initialize and apply the terraform plan.

    ```
    terraform init
    terraform apply
    ```

    Enter `yes` to apply the plan.

5. After the apply completes, terraform displays the following message:

    <pre>
    export <b>PRODUCER_PROJECT</b>=<i>your-project-id</i>
    export <b>DATA_VPC</b>=<i>nsi-data</i>
    export <b>DATA_SUBNET</b>=<i>us-west1-data</i>
    export <b>REGION</b>=<i>us-west1</i>
    export <b>ZONE</b>=<i>us-west1-a</i>
    export <b>BACKEND_SERVICE</b>=<i>https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/your-project-id/regions/us-west1/backendServices/panw-nsi-lb</i></pre>


> [!IMPORTANT] 
> The `init-cfg.txt` includes `plugin-op-commands=geneve-inspect:enable` bootstrap parameter, allowing firewalls to handle GENEVE encapsulated traffic forwarded via packet intercept. 
> If this is not configured, packet intercept traffic will be dropped. 

<br>

# ***On the Consumer project***

## Create Consumer Environment

In the `consumer` directory, use the terraform plan to create a consumer environment. The terraform plan automatically creates a VPC (`consumer-vpc`), two debian VMs (`client-vm` & `web-vm`), an optional GKE cluster (`cluster1`), as well as the necessary NSI components: Endpoint Group, Endpoint Group Association, Security Profile, Security Profile Group, and Global Network Firewall Policy with rules.

> [!NOTE]
> The Endpoint Group is associated with the Deployment Group created in the Producer project. Ensure you have the producer project ID and deployment group ID from the previous steps.

1. In Cloud Shell, change to the `consumer` directory.

    ```
    cd
    cd google-cloud-nsi-ui-demo/consumer
    ```

2. Create a `terraform.tfvars`

    ```
    cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
    ```

3. Edit `terraform.tfvars` by setting values for the following variables:  
   

    | Variable | Description | Default |
    | :---- | :---- | :---- |
    | `project_id` | The project ID of the consumer environment. | `null` |
    | `mgmt_allowed_ips` | A list of IPv4 addresses that can access the VMs on `TCP:80,22`. | `["0.0.0.0/0"]` |
    | `region` | The region to deploy the consumer resources. | `us-west1` |
    | `create_gke` | Whether to create the GKE cluster. | `true` |
    | `producer_project_id` | The project ID of the producer environment. | `null` |
    | `deployment_group_id` | The ID of the deployment group created in the producer project. | `deployment-group` |

4. Initialize and apply the terraform plan.

    ```
    terraform init
    terraform apply
    ```

    Enter `yes` to apply the plan.

5. After the apply completes, terraform displays the following message:

    <pre>
    export <b>CONSUMER_PROJECT</b>=<i>your-project-id</i>
    export <b>CONSUMER_VPC</b>=<i>consumer-vpc</i>
    export <b>REGION</b>=<i>us-west1</i>
    export <b>ZONE</b>=<i>s-west1-a</i>
    export <b>CLIENT_VM</b>=<i>client-vm</i>
    export <b>CLUSTER</b>=<i>cluster1</i>
    export <b>ORG_ID</b>=<i>$(gcloud projects describe your-project-id --format=json | jq -r '.parent.id')</i></pre>

<br>

## Test Inspection

Test inspection by generating pseudo-malicious traffic between VMs and also between VMs and the internet.  Then, generate pseudo-malicious traffic within the GKE cluster (`cluster1`) to test pod-to-pod inspection.

### GCE Inspection
Simulate pseudo-malicious traffic for both east-west and north-south traffic flows.

1. In Cloud Shell, remotely generate pseudo-malicious traffic on the `client-vm` to simulate malicious traffic to the `web-vm` (east/west) and to the `internet` (north/south).

    ```
    gcloud compute ssh $CLIENT_VM \
        --zone $ZONE \
        --tunnel-through-iap \
        --command="bash -s" << 'EOF'
    curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://www.eicar.org/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/bin/sh --data "echo Content-Type: text/plain; echo; uname -a" --max-time 2
    curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://www.eicar.org/cgi-bin/user.sh -H "FakeHeader:() { :; }; echo Content-Type: text/html; echo ; /bin/uname -a" --max-time 2
    curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://10.1.0.20/cgi-bin/user.sh -H "FakeHeader:() { :; }; echo Content-Type: text/html; echo ; /bin/uname -a" --max-time 2
    curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://10.1.0.20/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/etc/passwd --max-time 2
    EOF
    ```

    (output)
    
    <pre>
    <b>000
    000 
    000
    000</b></pre>

    > The `000` response codes indicate that the traffic was blocked by the producer. 
    > The *out-of-band* deployment will not produce `000` response codes since it is only monitoring the traffic.


2. Retrieve the firewall’s management address.

    ```
    gcloud compute instances list \
        --filter='tags.items=(panw-tutorial)' \
        --format='table[box,title="Firewall MGMT"](networkInterfaces[0].accessConfigs[0].natIP:label=EXTERNAL_IP, networkInterfaces[0].networkIP:label=INTERNAL_IP)'
    ```

3. Access the firewall’s web interface using the management address.

    <pre>
    https://<b><i>MGMT_ADDRESS</i></b></pre>
    Username:
    ```
    admin
    ```
    Password:
    ```
    PaloAlto@123
    ```
---

4. On the firewall, go to **Monitor → Threat** to confirm the firewall prevented the north/south and east/west threats generated by the `client-vm` .
